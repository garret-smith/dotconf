! The Microsoft/Apple Dvorak keyboard, with facing [] and {} keys. 
! Tweaked by Don Reed (don_AT_alcuin.com, don_AT_veritas.com) from 
! Dylan McNamee's tweaks to Jeff Bigler's ANSI Dvorak keyboard.

! The following is an unpaid commercial announcement: !
! This keyboard puts the bracket and braces on facing keys, with a brace 
! a shifted bracket, rather than the right and left one being shifted and
! unshifted versions of each other. (I have never been able to remember which
! is which, which is why all QWERTY computer keyboards put the [] and {} 
! characters on facing keys, rather than separating them with a shift. 
! This Dvorak keyboard does not comply with the ANSI standard, because while
! the standard leaves many keys unspecified, it requires the =+ key to have
! the same location it has on the QWERTY layout, for reasons that are not
! apparent. In my opinion, it is much more important to put the [] and {}
! on facing keys than to keep the =+ key where it is. This arrange has another
! advantage: if a keyboard is curved, rather than having sculpted keycaps,
! you can rearrange the actual keys to a Dvorak layout without ordering custom
! custom keycaps, because the shifted/unshifted characters are paired as on the
! QWERTY layout.
!
! This keyboard has been shipped on DOS and Windows, and has been used on
! the Apple IIc, the Apple IIGS, and various other Apple computers for years.
! If anything, it is more standard than the ANSI standard, because it has
! actually been widely distributed.

! This file should be given as an argument to xmodmap to 
! switch from a qwerty to a Dvorak keyboard. !
! Note that Null translations have been included as ! comments.
!
! If you want to be easily able to switch the keyboard 
! back to its previous state, first run xmodmap -pke and 
! redirect the output to a file. Then you can switch back 
! by giving that file as an argument to xmodmap. For 
! example, if you type:
!
!	xmodmap -pke > /tmp/keyboard.default
!
! before switching the keyboard, you can then type: !
!	xmodmap /tmp/keyboard.default
!
! to reset the keyboard to its previous state. !
! Note that if you pass this file again as an argument to 
! xmodmap, you will apply these translations a second time 
! and come out with gibberish!
